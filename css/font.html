  <h1>Roboto Condensed</h1>
  <p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
    largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
    curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
    Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
    width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
    humanist and serif types.</p>
